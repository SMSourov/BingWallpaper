The [Microsoft Bing](bing.com) search engine provides a beautiful picture every day, and I got tired of manually downloading and renaming the picture each time I wanted to add one to my collection. I decided to solve the problem and cobbled together this all-in-one solution. I run it as a nightly task. Problem solved.

Using the Bing API, you can easily get the images for your own use. This script will grab the current Bing wallpaper of the day, save it to a specified folder using the descriptive copyright title and date, and then set it as your desktop wallpaper. There are also options to specify the wallaper style (Example: Fill, Fit, Stretch, etc.) to use.

### This project is not my own project. I've forked this project and made some modifications for my own personal use.
I my own testing, this PowerShell file can download the UHD picture. By default, it will save the HD and UHD picture in Pictures folder and will not set the desktop background image.

The project where this project is forked from: [caressofsteel/bingwallpaper](https://github.com/caressofsteel/bingwallpaper)
