### Gets/Saves/Sets Big Wallpaper of the Day.
---
The [Microsoft Bing](bing.com) search engine provides a beautiful picture every day, and I got tired of using browser dev tools to download and rename the picture each time I wanted to add one to my collection. I decided to solve the problem and cobbled together this all-in-one solution. I run it as a nightly task. Problem solved.

Using the Bing API, you can easily get the images for your own use. This script will grab the current Bing wallpaper of the day, save it to a specified folder using the descriptive copyright title and date, and then set it as your desktop wallpaper. There are also options to specify what type of wallaper style (Example: Fill, Fit, Stretch, etc.) to use.
